This file is part of Aurora HUD v1.1 which is released under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

This file represents my reverse engineering of the files which define Freelancer's user interface.

With Freelancer, many files and UTF nodes are redundant. For example, backgroundpattern.tga is loaded 
only from multi_attentionreq'd.cmp but amost every .cmp includes it. My guess is that only the first
texture of each name is loaded, similarly to how adding textures with the same name to one .cmp only
loads the first one. Though a tedious task to go through, I hope documenting which files actually make
a difference (and what they do) will be useful both to myself and others.

A tip is to use findstr, e.g. `findstr /m /S "#24" *` to look for common nodes in files.

All paths relative to the DATA/INTERFACE folder.

    buttontextures.txm
        Holds the textures for cursors and buttons. The texture HUD_targetingelement holds graphics for the various cursors that
        appear while in space. Each graphic is a mask for either an "outline" or "inline" - in both cases the game replaces white
        with another another colour. For Aurora I edited the "outline" masks to make them black, replacing the blue colour of vanilla.

INTRO/OBJECTS
    multi_attentionreq'd.cmp
        The most important file of them all. Sets background texture, frame edge texture and frame animation colour for the entire game.
         edgecolor.tgaglowedge8.tga sets box perimeter animation texture
        30.tgaframetexture sets frame outline texture. I chromad this to white and then gated it 0.75. Might want to try making it grey.
        HUD_gradientblue.tgaglowedge10.tga is box perimeter texture
        backgroundpattern.tga is the tiled background texture
        Also sets frame colour for the attention required window.
    front_serverselect.cmp
        Sets server selection screen frame inner colour.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
    front_characselectbox.cmp
        Sets character selection screen frame inner colour and perimeter texture. (INV)
    multi_charactercreation.cmp
        Sets character creation dialogue frame inner colour and perimeter texture.
    front_infowindow.cmp
        Sets refresh texture for widgets on multiplayer character selection screen.
        
NEURONET
    errorexplanation.cmp
        Sets frame colour and edge texture for the multiplayer game type selection dialogue.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.

NEURONET/CHAT
    chat_background.cmp
        Again pretty self-explanatory, sets the decorator colour for the multiplayer chat dialogue. Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
    
NEURONET/INVENTORY
    front_button.cmp
        Sets scanline texture (refreshtest2) and frame inner colour for intro buttons (edit HUD_darkblue, offset 11-14). This colour is also used for the
         background of the loading bar.
    char_infowindow.cmp
        Sets frame inner colour and edge texture for the game dialogues opened with the panel at the top right of the HUD, with the exception of the chat window.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
    front_options_box2.cmp
        Sets the frame inner colour for the options (aka preferences/settings) window when accessed from in-game.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
    front_shortoptions_box2.cmp
        Sets the frame inner colour for the options (aka preferences/settings) window when accessed from the main menu.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
    repair_backgrnd.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the repair window. (INV)
    inv_biginforcard.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the dealer (commodity and equipment) windows (INV)
        
NEURONET/NEWSVENDOR
    news_background.cmp
        Sets frame inner colour for job board and news windows. Edit Material library > Material #345021127001310.

NEURONET/NAVMAP/NEWNAVMAP
    navmap_background.cmp
        Sets colour of navmap inside frame. Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
        TODO: set colour of edges of popout windows - this doesn't seem to be a texture or anything (probably in left/right.tga)
    zoomedmap_liberty.3db
        Stores the texture of the navmap background.
    nav_selector.3db
        Sets selector square texture.
    nav_zoomin.cmp
        Sets the background textures of all four navmap control buttons (zoom in, zoom out, info, select as target).
    
        
NEURONET/OPTIONS
    alt-f4window.cmp
        No prizes for guessing here, this file sets the decorator colour for the "Exit Game" and "Quit to Main Menu" dialogues.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc.
      
    escapewindow2.cmp
        Sets the frame inner colour and edge texture for the F1 menu.
        Edit Material library > INV_insideframecolor > Dc and Texture library > HUD_gradientblue.tgaglowedge5.tga.
        
HUD
    For these files we need to edit Material #24021004123005 which is the equivalent of INV_insideframecolor in other directories.
    manueverbox3 and 2 seemingly does nothing.
    
    The texture of the pop-out frames on the navbar is set by a file in HUD for the space-side (don't know which one, sorry) and the
    texture for base-side is set in multi-attnrequired.
    
    hud_maneuverbox5.cmp
        Sets the frame colour of the space-side (not docked) nav-bar in the top center.
    hud_maneuverbox6.cmp
        Sets the frame colour of the base-side (docked) nav-bar in the top center.
    hud_numberboxes.cmp
        Sets the frame colour of the thruster and velocity panels to the left and right of the central gauge panel respectively.
    hud_shipinfo.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the bottom-right panel which displays weapon status, when maximised. Remember to redo this file
    hud_shipinfo_min.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the bottom-right panel which displays weapon status, when minimised.
    hud_target.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the bottom-left panel which displays contact status, when maximised.
    hud_target_min.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the bottom-left panel which displays contact status, when minimised.
    hud_nnbox5.cmp
        Sets the frame colour for the top-right panel, both space-side and base-side.
        Also sets the textures for most HUD elements. Edit HUD_gradientbluefinal.tgaHUD_glowedgefinal.tga and refreshtest2.tga
        The exception is hud_shipinfo.cmp which seems to inherit from the rest of the interface...
    hud_nnbox7.cmp
        Same as hud_nnbox5.cmp but for multiplayer. Yeah, really.
    hud_guagewindow.cmp (sic)
        Sets the frame colour for the bottom-center panel containing status bars.
