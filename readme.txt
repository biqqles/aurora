                                                    Known issues/future work
 - Navbar perimeter animation skips once every few cycles
 - hud_shipinfo.cmp is a copy of hud_target.cmp so the animations go the wrong way (they should be mirror images)
 - Baside navbar popout is still blue (cannot find the file for this)
 - During the vendor window opening animation the blue frame colour is visible. Presumably this is just another file
    that needs to be changed.
 - Freelancer offsets the navmap background by a couple of pixels because the left margin isn't taken into account.
    It might be possible to fix this (extremely minor though).
